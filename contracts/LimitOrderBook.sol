/*
Types of Order:

A stop loss order triggers a market buy/sell when the mark price is above/below limit price

A take profit order triggers a market buy/sell when the mark price is below/above limit price

Trailing stop orders are stop loss orders with dynamic limit price - can this be done??

Please note that the price the orders get filled at may not be the limit price.

For longs:
Take profit: sell when MP > LP. set minimum output to that of LP - therefore you are guaranteed to get moreÂ§
Stop loss: sell when MP < LP. set minimum output to that of LP - this doesn't work so we need to do some clever stuff
  * market sells your asset at the NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE
Stop LIMIT - sell when MP < SP but only if it is above LP

For shorts:
Take profit: buy when MP < LP. set minimum output to that of LP - you should get more if blah
Stop loss: buy when MP > LP. issue here with minimum output.
STOP LIMIT BUY - buy when MP > SP but only if it is below LP

Take profit and Stop loss are REDUCE ONLY

Standard LIMIT BUY / LIMIT SELL are not reduce only

Parameters that we need:
ASSET ->  Address for the AMM
TRADER -> Address for the user
ORDER TYPE -> ENUM: Market, Limit, Stop-Market, Stop-Limit, Trailing-Stop
LIMIT PRICE -> Decimal
STOP PRICE -> Decimal
REDUCE-ONLY -> Bool
ORDER SIZE -> Decimal
COLLATERAL -> Decimal
LEVERAGE -> Decimal
??SLIPPAGE?? -> we should explicitly state that stop-market orders have zero slippage
FEE -> Decimal
EXPIRY -> uint block timestamp
block that order was placed in (for trailing loss)
TRAILING_TYPE =
TRAILING_ABS =
TRAILING_PCT =

Slippage needs to be done in a certain way, as we will not be able to get the off-chain price..

Limit buy - slippage, should be from limit PRICE
stop-market sell - sell when price goes below X - ?accept unlimited slippage-

stop-limit sell - sell when price below X but you can calculate slippage from LP
